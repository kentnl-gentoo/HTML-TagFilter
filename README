HTML::TagFilter 0.072

DESCRIPTION

HTML::TagFilter is a subclass of HTML::Parser with a
single purpose: it will remove unwanted html tags and attributes from a
piece of text. It can act in a more or less fine-grained way - you can
specify permitted tags, permitted attributes of each tag, and permitted
values for each attribute in as much detail as you like.

For many uses the following will suffice:

use HTML::TagFilter; 
my $tf = new HTML::TagFilter; 
my $clean_html = $tf->filter($dirty_html);

But you can also specify your own rule sets, tweak the behaviour of the
filter and generally do what you like. There's lots of documentation in pod.
