HTML::TagFilter 0.08

DESCRIPTION

HTML::TagFilter is a subclass of HTML::Parser with a
single purpose: it will remove unwanted html tags and attributes from a
piece of text. It can act in a more or less fine-grained way - you can
specify permitted tags, permitted attributes of each tag, and permitted
values for each attribute in as much detail as you like.

For many uses the following will suffice:

use HTML::TagFilter; 
my $tf = new HTML::TagFilter; 
my $clean_html = $tf->filter($dirty_html);

But you can also specify your own rule sets, tweak the behaviour of the
filter and generally do what you like. There's lots of documentation in pod, 
and don't be put off by the low version number: there have been twenty-odd 
public releases and the interface is now mature, if not exactly friendly.
