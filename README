HTML::TagFilter 0.06

DESCRIPTION

HTML::TagFilter is a (tentatively named) subclass of HTML::Parser with a single purpose: it will remove unwanted html tags and attributes from a piece of text. It can act in a more or less fine-grained way - you can specify permitted tags, permitted attributes of each tag, and permitted values for each attribute in as much detail as you like.

For many uses the following will suffice:

	use HTML::TagFilter;
	my $tf = new HTML::TagFilter;
	my $clean_html = $tf->filter($dirty_html);
	
But you can specify your own rule sets, tweak the behaviour of the filter and generally do what you like. There's lots of pod.

INSTALLATION

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

as usual. You can run make test if you wish, but at the moment it's just a syntax check :(
