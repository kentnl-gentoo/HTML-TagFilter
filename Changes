Revision history for Perl extension TagFilter.

0.01  Fri Sep 14 01:19:43 2001
    Only permission filter: no denial rules.
    Worked quite well.
0.02  Mon Sep 17 2001
    Added denial rules. 
    Didn't work very well.
0.03  Tues Sep 18 2001
    Changed from trying to work out meaning of empty lists to using 
    reserved words 'any', 'all', 'none'. 
    Denial rules work for a while.
0.04  Wed Sep 19 2001
    Added _check() method to allow testing of values deep in HoHoHo 
    without autovivification and subsequent mess. 
    Denial rules become less ambitious, more useful. 
    Pod grows more verbose.
0.05  Wed Sep 20 2001
    Added tag/attribute removal logging, and 'log' option, in order 
    that users may be chastised in detail for putting in naughty html.
0.06  Sun Oct 21 2001
    Simplified interface with addition of ->filter() and ->report() methods
    Abandoned attempts to preserve tag order: put back on to do list :(
    Made pod even more windy.
    Added 'echo' option to direct output to STDOUT as a proper child 
    of HTML::Parser should, at Gisle Aas' suggestion. makes it more useful 
    to networking applications, i gather.
0.07  Thu Oct 25 2001
    no more warnings
    error() reporting. can now write 
    $foo = $tf->filter($bar) || die $tf->error 
    and get sensible output. main tests in place. 
 0.071  Thu Oct 25 2001
    changed default handler to escape < and > in order
    to prevent a common cross-site attack, thanks to 
    bug report posted in rt.cpan.org, of which author 
    was previously blissfully unaware.
